# CodSoft Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository showcasing the projects I completed during my internship at CodSoft! This internship focused on Python programming, where I gained hands-on experience and enhanced my skills by working on various tasks. Below is an overview of the projects I completed during this period.

## Projects

### 1. **Task 1: To-Do List Application**
   - **Description**: This project is a simple yet functional to-do list application built using Python. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, helping them manage their daily activities efficiently.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Add new tasks with a description.
     - Mark tasks as completed.
     - Delete tasks from the list.
     - User-friendly command-line interface.

   - **Technologies Used**: Python

### 2. **Task 2: Scientific Calculator**
   - **Description**: This project involves building a scientific calculator using Python's `tkinter` library. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations as well as more complex scientific calculations like trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
     - Handle scientific functions (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.).
     - Interactive and easy-to-use GUI.

   - **Technologies Used**: Python, `tkinter` library

### 3. **Task 3: Password Generator**
   - **Description**: This project is a password generator application that creates secure and random passwords based on user-defined criteria. The generated passwords can be stored securely in a local SQLite database.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Generate strong passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.
     - Specify the length of the password.
     - Store generated passwords securely in a database.
     - GUI for user interaction.

   - **Technologies Used**: Python, `tkinter` library, SQLite
